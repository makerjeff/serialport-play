# SERIAL PORT PLAY
Starting again and playing with Node => Arduino communication.

###Links
- [NYU ITP Node Serialport Tutorial](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-communication-with-node-js/)
- [NVM installation via Homebrew](http://dev.topheman.com/install-nvm-with-homebrew-to-use-multiple-versions-of-node-and-iojs-easily/): !! Also, simple tutorial for PATHs in .bash_profile.
- [String.trim()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim): Returns a string stripped of white spaces from both ends.

###APIs / Libraries Used
- [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html): Line by line input, like Python's input()
- [SerialPort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport): (Newer than the one in the NYU ITP Node Serialport Tutorial, different API.)
- [Basic Commandline Interactive Loop](https://jttan.com/2016/06/node-js-basic-command-line-interactive-loop/): Solves the twitching UI issue when trying to do an interactive loop like in Python.
